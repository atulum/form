            <h1>Memory Sharing Agreement</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Your privacy, security, and consent matter</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>This agreement establishes the terms and conditions under which holographic memories are shared using the Echoris platform. It aims to ensure that both the User and the Recipient understand their rights, responsibilities, and limitations when it comes to accessing and interacting with the shared content. This mutual understanding fosters trust, security, and the seamless sharing of emotional and impactful memories.</p>

            <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
            <p>The Recipient is granted limited access to specific holographic memories shared by the User. This access includes the ability to view and interact with these memories, such as providing Feelbacks or comments, as permitted by the User. The User retains full control over permissions and has the right to revoke access at any time without prior notice. Any attempt to bypass these permissions is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate suspension of access.</p>

            <h2>3. Privacy</h2>
            <p>All holographic memories shared on the Echoris platform are encrypted to ensure privacy and security. The Recipient is prohibited from copying, redistributing, or publicly displaying any shared content without the explicit consent of the User. By agreeing to these terms, the Recipient acknowledges the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of shared moments and agrees to uphold the User’s privacy rights at all times.</p>

            <h2>4. Disputes</h2>
            <p>In the event of any disagreements, such as unauthorized use of memories or privacy breaches, both parties agree to resolve the matter through mediation facilitated by Echoris. If a resolution cannot be reached, further action may involve arbitration or legal proceedings in accordance with the platform’s policies and local laws. The User and the Recipient also agree to notify Echoris immediately in case of disputes to ensure timely intervention.</p>

            <h2>5. Termination</h2>
            <p>This agreement remains in effect until terminated by either party. Termination can be initiated by providing written notice through the platform or using the designated termination feature in the Echoris app. Upon termination, all access to shared memories is revoked, and the Recipient must delete any locally stored content to ensure compliance with the platform’s privacy standards.</p>

            <h2>Experience Description</h2>
            <p><em>"I’ll never forget that evening at Galata Tower. The sun was setting, casting a warm golden glow over the city, and the sky was streaked with shades of pink and orange. The atmosphere felt alive, with street performers playing music, the hum of conversations, and the occasional sound of laughter from the nearby cafes. Just as I turned the corner, I noticed a small crowd gathering near the base of the tower. Curious, I saw him, dressed in a sharp suit, holding a small velvet box in his hands. He looked nervous but determined as he knelt on one knee in front of her. She froze for a moment, her hands flying to her mouth, her eyes wide with shock and tears starting to form. The world seemed to pause as everyone held their breath, waiting for her reaction. Then, she smiled—a radiant, tearful smile—and nodded. The crowd erupted into cheers and applause, and some people even pulled out their phones to capture the moment. As they hugged, the light of the setting sun framed them perfectly, like a scene out of a dream. It was one of those moments that felt like pure magic, the kind you wish you could bottle up and keep forever. I couldn’t resist pulling out my Echoris and capturing it. Every time I revisit it, I can hear the clapping, feel the warmth of the sunset, and remember the overwhelming sense of love and connection in the air. It’s not every day you witness a moment like that, and I feel so lucky to have been there to experience it."</em></p>
